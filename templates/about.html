			<p class='vertical-center1'>This project was created in order to learn the basics of web application development with Flask. The game was first recreated in Python. The AI is a simple node-searching artificial intelligence. It looks at the possible game states for each possible move. It creates all the possible game states with all the moves that are possible with one to five moves. It then uses a board evaluation function to determine scores to assign to each game state. The AI then chooses the move that provides the best score, and makes that move. The Flask app takes the information from the game model and inputs it into the HTML template. Then the user is redirected back to the page, in order for the Flask app to execute code. Flask is not an ideal environment for a game of this type, because Flask requires the user to be directed to a page in order for the Flask app to execute code. Thus, with every move that either the user or the AI makes, the user is redirected back to the same page, and the browser must load the page once again. The web application also incorporates JavaScript and jQuery. </p>

			<p class='vertical-center2'>I am <a id='resume-link' href='http://runnersaw.github.io'>Sawyer Vaughan</a>. I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering major at the Olin College of Engineering in Needham, MA. This game was recreated from the game 2048, created by Gabriele Cirulli. The AI was created by myself, independently of all of the other 2048 AI's. </p>
